\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This is the Dangerous Doughnuts' organisation plan for the 1st Team
Project of the PSD3 course. It consists of \ref{lastSection}
chapters. Chapter \ref{intro} is an introduction to this document,
chapter \ref{role} includes the roles of each member of the team, the decision making process is kept in chapter \ref{auth} and chapter \ref{com} deals with the ways the members will communicate. The last two chapters of this document contain the information management process and the underlying risks in the team's organisational decisions.

%\subsection{Document Status and Schedule}
%Describe the status, including goals and dates, for production and
%revision of the document.  Documentation is often generated
%incrementally and iteratively. If this is the case for this document,
%also summarise here the planned updates and their release dates.

\section{Roles}
\label{role}

Initially, the team members will have loosely defined roles(MUDs model). The first plan is that the toolsmiths will be both Paweł Drewniak and Motiejus Jakštys, providing the team with the necessary tools for the development process, such as the version control system. Horatiu-Sorin Bota and Andrew MacLeod will be will also be responsible of the quality assurance, gathering of the requirements and providing documentation. Finally, the coding will be assigned to Paweł Drewniak, Motiejus Jakštys and Konstantinos Dadamis. The roles given will not be strict and whichever section turns out to be more demanding, more team members will be assigned to it.  

This first plan is only a draft and as time progresses, there will be a better understanding of each member's abilities and the team organisation will evolve with new roles emerging.
